# üêù JavaMQTT ‚Äì MQTT so simple, even your toaster could use it.

Yo, welcome to **JavaMQTT** ‚Äì a minimalist MQTT wrapper for Java and Android devs who just want to send data, not write dissertations on `IMqttToken`. No AndroidX, no `MqttAndroidClient` drama. Just vibes and messages flying over TCP/SSL.

## ‚ú® Why JavaMQTT?

Because Paho is powerful but looks like it was designed to make you cry at 3 AM.

So we:
- Wrapped it ‚ú® cleanly
- Hid the scary stuff (like `SSLSocketFactory`)
- Made the API cute, concise, and production-ready
- And yeah... it *just works* üöÄ

---

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Pure Java (works on Android and Java SE)
- ‚úÖ Uses `MqttAsyncClient` for non-blocking swag
- ‚úÖ Auto reconnect & auto resubscribe
- ‚úÖ QoS configurable (0/1/2 like a boss)
- ‚úÖ Retained message support
- ‚úÖ Global & per-topic message listeners
- ‚úÖ Callback on reconnect
- ‚úÖ Safe threading with executor pools
- ‚úÖ SSL support with optional "trust all" (for testing... pls don‚Äôt ship to production with that üò≠)

## üß™ Installation

Use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io) or Maven Central (your call, king üëë).

```gradle
implementation 'io.github.initio:JavaMQTT:1.0.0'
````

---

## ‚ö° Usage

### üîå Connecting

```java
JavaMQTT mqtt = new JavaMQTT(
    "ssl://broker.hivemq.com:8883",
    "my-client-id",
    getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath(),  // For Android
    command -> new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).post(command)
);

mqtt.connect("username", "password", new JavaMQTT.ConnectionListener() {
    public void onSuccess() {
        Log.d("MQTT", "Connected üéâ");
    }

    public void onFailure(Throwable e) {
        Log.e("MQTT", "Bruh, connect failed üíÄ: " + e.getMessage());
    }
});
```

---

### üì¨ Subscribe

```java
mqtt.subscribe("device/led1", (topic, payload) -> {
    Log.d("MQTT", "Got message on " + topic + ": " + payload);
});
```

---

### üì§ Publish

```java
mqtt.put("device/led1", "1");           // Send without retain
mqtt.putRetain("device/led1", "0");     // Send with retain
```

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Auto Resubscribe

Set a listener so whenever reconnect happens, you resub everything:

```java
mqtt.setOnReconnectListener(() -> {
    mqtt.subscribe("device/led1", listener);
    mqtt.subscribe("device/fan", anotherListener);
});
```

---

### üåç Global Listener

Catch all messages in one place (if you're lazy or building a message router):

```java
mqtt.setGlobalListener((topic, payload) -> {
    Log.d("MQTT", "Yo we got " + payload + " from " + topic);
});
```

---

### üò¥ Disconnect

```java
mqtt.disconnect();  // Peace out üïäÔ∏è
mqtt.close();       // Clean up memory like a responsible adult
```

---

## üîê SSL Warning

We‚Äôre using a "trust-all" SSL context for testing/dev only. For real-world apps, plug in a proper cert-based factory. Your data deserves respect. üò§
